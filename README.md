###Who Am I?
Welcome to my Github page! Between undergraduate research, internships and working post-grad I've been an engineer for about 8 years and worked almost two years as a data analyst. I'm now going back to school to work towards Data Science!

###Why Change Careers?
I *know*, it sounds crazy. My time as an engineer introduced me to Tableau and the capabilities of SQL. I enjoyed more of my time querying and building dashboards over my time conducting failure analysis.
